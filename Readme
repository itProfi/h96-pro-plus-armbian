Get armbian working on my h96 pro plus tv box (green pcb ver)

hardware specs:
 - cpu: amlogic s912
 - memory: 3gb ddr3
 - ethernet: RTL8211F
 - wifi: Fn-link 8223A-SR (QCA9377)
 
 With meson-gxm-q200.dtb included in armbian you can boot armbian just ok but there is no wifi, so I created meson-gxm-q200-mod.dtb that supports qca9377.
 Also copy lib-firmware/* to /lib/firmware/ .
 
 There are some problems: no gpu acceleration, no hdmi audio, bluetooth failed to start. But it is enough to be used as a headless server.
